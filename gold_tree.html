        <p>We had a vibrant Autumn with several warm days and cool nights. My city is known for it's trees. While I was looking for items to write about in this project I spied this particular tree. It's gold was luminescent and trunk bark sharply contrasting the almost supernatural glow of the leaves.</p>
        <p>When I found this poem the vivid color took on a new meaning to me. I absorbed the beauty of this tree while it was in this glorious state. I had no expectation that the next day would allow me even the briefest glimpse of this show.</p>
        <p>Right now there are beautiful things to observe, but not the gold of that tree. I'm glad I stood in appreciation of that moment, that tree.</p>

        <p>by Robert Frost</p>
        <p>Nature’s first green is gold,</p>
        <p>Her hardest hue to hold.</p>
        <p>Her early leaf’s a flower;</p>
        <p>But only so an hour.</p>
        <p>Then leaf subsides to leaf.</p>
        <p>So Eden sank to grief,</p>
        <p>So dawn goes down to day.</p>
        <p>Nothing gold can stay.</p>
