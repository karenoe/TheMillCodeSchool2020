        <p>In September, I committed to participate in <a href="https://www.gener8torupskilling.com/mill-code-school" target="_blank">The Mill Code School</a>. I didn't have extra time, but I did have extra motivation to learn and participate in a community. </p>
        <p>I decided early on that an open mind and determination were skills I could bring to the table. Partnering with people who genuinely had my best interest in mind I watched over 50 hours of quality online learning modules and practiced using a variety of coding tools.</p>
        <p>I knew at the start we'd be creating our own website, and I decided my topic would be gratitude. I kept my eye open for some content and snapped some pictures while taking in and considering each moment at the time.</p>
        <p>The following pages are the ones I liked the best.</p>
      </article>
      <div class="divider-wrapper">
        <div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div>
      </div><!--divider-wrapper end-->
      <aside class="grid-item">
        <p>Joy is not a constant. It comes to us in moments - often ordinary moments. Sometimes we miss out on the bursts of joy because we're too busy chasing down the extraordinary moments. Other times we're so afraid of the dark we don't dare let ourselves enjoy the light.</p>
        <p>A joyful life is not a floodlight of joy. That would eventually become unbearable. I believe a joyful life is made up of joyful moments gracefully strung together by trust, gratitude and inspiration</p>
