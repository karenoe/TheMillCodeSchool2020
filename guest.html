      <p>COVID-19 and the extra stresses beyond it put me into a mindset of "what next"?</p>
      <p>But part way through the year, I came across this poem and wondered if the crises were my problem or my attitude toward the problem.</p>
      <p>I started thinking of the rules and issues as opportunities to think differently. I felt more peaceful and didn't react the same way to circumstances. I paused and considered responses instead.</p>
      <p>When information about The Mill Code School caught my eye, I recognized a challenging opportunity that could not have presented itself at a better time. I brought an open mind and motivated curiosity to the experience. I decided I could just show up each day, do my best, and let the outcome take care of itself.</p>
      <p>Participation in this program has shaped my work habits, improved my understanding of both coding and business soft skills, and helped me think about my future and how I might continue to grow as a developer. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" alt="LinkedIn">LinkedIn Learning</a> provided the curriculum and every module was high quality and useful. The structure of learning created a great atmosphere for practice and recommended many useful tools.</p>
      <p>The professional and approachable presence of the gener8or team (especially Cole's great leadership), support from <a href="https://dimensionmill.org/" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" alt="The Mill">The Mill</a>, guest speakers at Lunch and Learns, Jason my Technical Coach, my excellent Career Coach Claire, and mock interviews have been more than what I hoped for from this 10 week intensive. </p>
      <p>My gratitude also extends to <a href="https://bloomington.in.gov/" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" alt="City of Bloomington">The City of Bloomington</a> and the <a href="https://bloomington.in.gov/recoverforward" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" alt="Recover Forward">Recover Forward initiative</a>
        <p>For many people, COVID-19 stole a year. For me, COVID-19 gave me motivation and direction in my personal and professional life. It cleared me "out for some new delight". </a>

      <p class="poemTitle"> The Guest House</p>
        <p>This being human is a guest house.<br>
        Every morning a new arrival.</p>

        <p>A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>
        some momentary awareness comes<br>
        as an unexpected visitor.</p>

        <p>Welcome and entertain them all!<br>
        Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,<br>
        who violently sweep your house<br>
        empty of its furniture,<br>
        still, treat each guest honorably.<br>
        He may be clearing you out<br>
        for some new delight.</p>

        <p>The dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br>
        meet them at the door laughing,<br>
        and invite them in.</p>

        <p>Be grateful for whoever comes,<br>
        because each has been sent<br>
        as a guide from beyond.</p>
