Topic: <br>
  Visual Gratitude List<br>

Required Components I included: <br>
A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu) <br>

Use CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes  <br>

Additionally I focused on orderly code, commenting, and using css for fonts.
