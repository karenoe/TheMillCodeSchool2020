Topic: <br>
  Visual Gratitude List<br>

Feature Requirements: <br>
A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu) <br>

Use CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes  <br>

Additionally I focused on orderly code, commenting, and using css for fonts. Some use of media queries. The navigation menu uses JavaScript which is in a separate file. I also practiced external links with rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" and alt tags.<br>

It is responsive.<br>
There are css elements in the file styles.css.<br>
I've commented my code.<br>
